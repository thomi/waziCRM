## Contributing
Thanks for your interest in contributing to Repo!! 

All the pull requests should be directed to the dev branch for peer reviewing then later after thorough testing and passing our CI/CD pipeline (Github Actions) and hopefully everything works well  dev will be merged to the main branch.

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create [a feature request](https://github.com/thomi/waziCRM/discussions/categories/ideas) to first discuss all new ideas. This helps anyone trying to follow up with the project know why we decided to do things the way did them, includes things like adding new php/laravel packages, styling/linting helpers, etc.
